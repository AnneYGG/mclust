         - MclustDA allows to fit a single class model.
         - fix bug in summary.Mclust when a subset is used for initialization.
         - fix a bug in the function qclass when ties are present in quantiles, 
           so it always return the required number of classes.
         - various small bug fixes.

         - new icl function for computing the integrated complete-data
           likelihood

         - corrected version of qclass for selecting initial values in 
           case of 1D data when successive quantiles coincide
         - corrected version of plot BIC values when only a single G
           component models are fitted
         - various bug fixes 

2012/08  version 4.0

         - included me.weighted function.
         - restored hierarchical clustering capability for the EEE model (hcEEE).
         - included vignettes for mclust version 4 from Technical Report 
           No. 597 and for using weights in mclust.
         - adoption of GPL (>= 2) license.

2012/04  version 3.6
         - bug fix: variable names lost when G = 1

2012/03  version 3.5
         - added summary.Mclust
         - new functions for plotting and summarizing density estimation
         - bug fixes
         - clustCombi (code and doc provided by Jean-Patrick Baudry)

2012/01  - added NAMESPACE
2011/05  - removed intrinsic gamma
2011/05  - fixed hypvol function to avoid overflow
         - fixed hypvol helpfile value description

2010/12  - fixed output when G = 1 (it had NA for the missing "z" component)
2010/10  - removed hierarchical clustering capability for the EEE model (hcEEE)
         - The R 2.12.0 build failed due to a 32-bit Windows compiler error,
           forcing removal of the underlying Fortran code for hcEEE from the
           package, which does not contain errors and compiles on other
           platforms.
2010/08  - added description of parameters output component to Mclust and
         - summary.mclustBIC help files
2010/07  - added densityMclust function
2010/04  - fixed bug in covariance matrix output for EEV and VEV models

2006 version of MCLUST, by Fraley and Raftery
(Dept. of Statistics, University of Washington)

Version 3.0: New functionality added, including conjugate priors 
for Bayesian regularization. 
Backward compatibility is not guaranteed since the implementation of some 
functions has changed to make them easier to use or maintain.

Version 3.1: Most plotting functions changed to use color.
Mclust/mclustBIC fixed to work with G=1
Otherwise backward compatible with version 3.0.

Version 3.1-1: Default seed changed in sim functions.
model name check added to various functions. 
Otherwise backward compatible with version 3.0
