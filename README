2006 version of MCLUST, by Fraley and Raftery
(Dept. of Statistics, University of Washington)

Version 3.0: New functionality added, including conjugate priors 
for Bayesian regularization. 
Backward compatibility is not guaranteed since the implementation of some 
functions has changed to make them easier to use or maintain.

Version 3.1: Plotting functions changed mainly to use color.
Otherwise backward compatible with version 3.0
