2006 version of MCLUST, by Fraley and Raftery
(Dept. of Statistics, University of Washington)

New functionality added, including conjugate priors for Bayesian 
regularization. 
Backward compatibility is not guaranteed since the implementation of some 
functions has changed to make them easier to use or maintain.
