R port of the 2002 version of MCLUST, by Fraley and Raftery
(Dept. of Statistics, University of Washington) by Ron Wehrens.

Note that this version differs considerably from the older version.

The Splus functionality is fully present with (as yet) one exception:
the "mclust" option for the Splus density function, as described in
the technical report (contained in directory inst/doc/tr415.ps.gz).
